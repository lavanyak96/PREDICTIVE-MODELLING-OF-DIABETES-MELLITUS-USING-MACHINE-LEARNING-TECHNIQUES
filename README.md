Diabetes mellitus is a chronic and progressive metabolic disorder that poses a significant global health challenge, affecting individuals across all age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds. Characterized by persistent hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin production, impaired insulin function, or both, diabetes can lead to severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and increased mortality if left undiagnosed or poorly managed. Early detection is essential but remains difficult due to the asymptomatic onset and the multifactorial nature of the disease. With the increasing availability of healthcare data and advances in computational methods, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for early disease prediction and risk stratification. 
This study presents a machine learning framework for the early prediction of diabetes mellitus using a publicly available clinical dataset comprising physiological attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, and age. A thorough data preprocessing pipeline was implemented, including data cleaning, standardization, and correlation-based feature analysis to reduce redundancy and improve model performance. Three models were developed and evaluated: Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network, and a Hybrid Voting Classifier combining both. 
The Random Forest model achieved the highest overall accuracy (93.33%) and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.90, reflecting strong and balanced predictive performance. The MLP model, while capable of capturing non-linear patterns, showed less consistent results with a lower hold-out accuracy (66.7%) and an MCC of 0.52. The Hybrid RF + MLP model offered a practical compromise, attaining an accuracy of 86.6% and a high MCC of 0.81, indicating stable performance across all classes and improved generalizability. 
These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating machine learning into clinical workflows for early and accurate diabetes diagnosis. The proposed framework balances accuracy with interpretability, supporting healthcare professionals in proactive decision-making. Future work may focus on incorporating longitudinal patient data, deploying real-time prediction systems, and utilizing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to further enhance clinical transparency and trust.
Results and Analysis :
•	Random Forest outperformed MLP in every metric.
•	The RF model was not only more accurate but also more consistent across all classes, crucial for clinical applications where every type of patient (mild, moderate, severe diabetic) needs to be identified.
•	MLP’s performance was inconsistent, especially for mid-stage diabetic cases (Class 1), possibly due to its sensitivity to hyperparameters and limited sample size in the test set.
•	The Hybrid RF + MLP model provided a balanced middle ground—though its accuracy was slightly lower than the standalone RF, it offered more stable predictions across all classes than MLP alone. Its relatively high MCC (0.81) and consistent recall rates indicate that combining models can enhance generalizability and minimize class-wise bias, making it a reliable alternative in complex classification scenarios.
CONCLUSION

This study presents a robust and interpretable machine learning framework for the early prediction of diabetes mellitus by leveraging Random Forest, MLP Neural Network, and a Hybrid RF + MLP voting ensemble.

The Random Forest model achieved the highest predictive accuracy and interpretability, making it a strong candidate for integration into real-world clinical workflows. Meanwhile, the hybrid model emerged as a promising alternative, offering improved class-wise balance and consistent performance, especially in scenarios where multi-class prediction and generalizability are crucial.

The success of these models was further supported by effective preprocessing strategies, feature selection through correlation analysis, and the use of cross-validation for robust performance evaluation. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning to assist healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and prevention of diabetes mellitus.
